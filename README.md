### Goal

The goal for this project is to create a command line calculator. When the application is running you can either 
assign a value to a variable, which must be all letters, you can retrieve the value of a variable, or you can 
calculate the answer of an equation, with or without variables. The calculator accepts the following operations, in 
order of priority:
 1. Parenthesis ('(', ')');
 1. Power (^);
 1. Multiplication and division (*, /);
 1. Addition and subtraction (+, -).
